# Programming Notes

This repository is just a collection of random notes and observations I'm making in various areas of programming.

It's mostly for my own reference.

Some of it will be very basic. Some of it s little complex. I am most likely to refer back to this stuff at some point.

This repository is also an [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) vault, so there may be some markdown specific to that platform.
