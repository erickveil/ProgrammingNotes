Handling versioning in an iOS app developed with C++/Qt involves a combination of version control practices and ensuring that your app's versioning aligns with iOS App Store requirements. 

### Use Git for Source Control
- **Repository Initialization**: Initialize a Git repository if you havenâ€™t already:
  ```sh
  git init
  ```

- **Commit Regularly**: Commit changes regularly with meaningful commit messages. This helps track the history of changes.
  ```sh
  git add .
  git commit -m "Your commit message"
  ```

- **Branching Strategy**: Use branches for feature development, bug fixes, and releases. Common strategies include Git Flow or GitHub Flow.
  ```sh
  git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
  ```

### Semantic Versioning
Adopt Semantic Versioning (SemVer) for your app versioning, which follows the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:

- **MAJOR**: Increments for incompatible API changes.
- **MINOR**: Increments for backward-compatible functionality.
- **PATCH**: Increments for backward-compatible bug fixes.

### Update Version Numbers in `Info.plist`
- **CFBundleShortVersionString**: This is the version number displayed to users (e.g., 1.2.0).
- **CFBundleVersion**: This is the build number, which should increment with every release (e.g., 123).

Edit `Info.plist` to reflect the correct version and build number.

```xml
<key>CFBundleShortVersionString</key>
<string>1.2.0</string>
<key>CFBundleVersion</key>
<string>123</string>
```

### Automate Versioning with Scripts
Automate the update of version numbers and build numbers using scripts. This can be part of your build pipeline.

**Example script to update `CFBundleVersion`:**

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Increment build number
buildNumber=$(/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Print CFBundleVersion" "path/to/your/Info.plist")
buildNumber=$((buildNumber + 1))
/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Set :CFBundleVersion $buildNumber" "path/to/your/Info.plist"

echo "Updated build number to $buildNumber"
```

### Tagging Releases
Tag your releases in Git to keep track of different versions.

```sh
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release version 1.2.0"
git push origin v1.2.0
```

### Continuous Integration (CI)
Set up a CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Travis CI, CircleCI) to automate building, testing, and deploying your app. Ensure that your CI pipeline updates the build number and possibly even the version number automatically.

**Example GitHub Actions Workflow:**

```yaml
name: iOS Build

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: macos-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Xcode
        uses: maxim-lobanov/setup-xcode@v1

      - name: Increment build number
        run: ./scripts/increment_build_number.sh

      - name: Build and test
        run: xcodebuild -workspace YourApp.xcworkspace -scheme YourApp -sdk iphonesimulator -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 12,OS=latest' clean build test
```

### Documenting Versions
Maintain a `CHANGELOG.md` to document changes in each release.

```markdown
# Changelog

## [1.2.0] - 2024-06-06
### Added
- New feature XYZ

### Fixed
- Bug ABC
```

### Submission to App Store
Ensure that your version number and build number are correctly set before submitting your app to the App Store. The App Store requires a unique build number for each submission.
